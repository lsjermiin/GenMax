PURPOSE     Written in R, the GenMax program package is designed to test whether the 
            Markovian property of an evolutionary process is retained recoded DNA.
             
FORMATS     Sequences must be stored in the sequential PHYLIP format. 
            Trees must be stored in the Newick format.
 
DATA TYPE   Sequences can be read as strings of nucleotides.

STATUS      Software complete

CITATION    Vera-Ruiz V.A., Robinson J., Jermiin L.S. 2021.
            A likelihood-ratio test for lumpability of phylogenetic data: Is the Markovian
            property of an evolutionary process retained in recoded DNA? (in review). 

DESCRIPTION The package gives functions written in R for maximum-likelihood analysis of 
            phylogenetic data. It requires the data in the sequential Phylip form (first 
            row number of taxa and number of sites separated by a space and other rows 
            with taxa name in ten positions followed by nucleotides), a newick file for 
            the tree and an initial parameter file giving values for 6 off diagonal 
            elements of S, 4 values of pi and edge length for each of the tree edges. 
            Illustration of commands using these is found in Example.txt


There are two files of functions: GenMax.R and LumpTest.R.

Main functions in GenMax.R (these generalize functions in MaxR to other than alphabets of 4)

                              matrices
getSummary                    Summarize results of search
initializeGlobaParam          Set up parameters for ML estimation
estimateMleParam              ML estimation of model parameters
